# Content Moderation UX Design
**Date:** 2025-11-06
**Status:** Approved
**Approach:** Progressive Disclosure (Approach 1)

## Overview

Improve visibility of content moderation features to ensure Apple App Store compliance while maintaining a clean, non-intrusive user experience. All backend services (ContentModerationService, ContentReportingService, MuteService) already exist and are fully functional.

## Problem Statement

- Report content functionality exists but is buried 3 levels deep in ShareVideoMenu
- Block user functionality has no UI exposure
- No central moderation control panel for users
- Apple App Store requires clearly visible content reporting mechanisms

## Design Goals

1. **Multi-location Access**: Report/Block available on video feed, profile screen, and share menu
2. **App Store Compliance**: Moderation features must be obviously visible to reviewers
3. **User Control**: Full moderation control center in Settings
4. **Non-intrusive**: Features visible but not dominating the UI
5. **Nostr-compliant**: Transparent about NIP-51 (mute lists) and NIP-56 (reporting)

## Architecture

### 1. Video Feed Item Enhancements
**File:** `mobile/lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart`

**Changes:**
- Add flag icon (🚩) to video overlay next to share button
- Icon specifications:
  - Size: 18px
  - Color: White with 70% opacity (normal), Orange (active)
  - Position: Right of share button in bottom action row

**Interaction:**
- Tap flag icon → Show bottom sheet with quick actions:
  1. "Report Content" (opens full NIP-56 report dialog)
  2. "Block @username" (shows confirmation dialog)
  3. "Not Interested" (temporary mute)
  4. "Cancel"

**Widget Test Coverage:**
- Flag icon renders on video feed items
- Tapping flag shows bottom sheet
- Bottom sheet contains all expected actions
- Actions are properly labeled

### 2. Profile Screen Block Button
**File:** `mobile/lib/screens/profile_screen_router.dart`

**Changes:**
- Add "Block User" button in profile header (other users only)
- Button specifications:
  - Style: Outlined button
  - Color: Red border and text
  - Position: Top-right, next to Follow button
  - States: "Block User" → "Unblock" (after blocking)

**Interaction:**
- Tap "Block User" → Show confirmation dialog:
  - Title: "Block @username?"
  - Body: "You won't see their content in feeds. They won't be notified. You can still visit their profile."
  - Actions: [Cancel (gray)] [Block (red)]
- After blocking: Button changes to "Unblock" (gray outline)

**Widget Test Coverage:**
- Block button appears on other users' profiles
- Block button does NOT appear on own profile
- Button shows "Unblock" when user is already blocked
- Tapping block shows confirmation dialog

### 3. Share Menu Reorganization
**File:** `mobile/lib/widgets/share_video_menu.dart`

**Changes:**
- Move "Content Actions" section from bottom to top (after Video Status)
- Rename section to "Safety Actions"
- Apply warning styling:
  - Background: `Colors.orange.withAlpha(26)` (0.1 opacity)
  - Border: `Colors.orange.withAlpha(77)` (0.3 opacity)
  - Icons: Orange color
- Add "Block User" action to this section

**New Section Order:**
1. Video Status (existing)
2. **⚠️ Safety Actions** (moved from bottom, styled)
   - Report Content
   - Block @username
3. Share With
4. Add to List
5. Bookmarks
6. Follow Sets
7. Delete (own content only)

**Widget Test Coverage:**
- Safety Actions section appears at top
- Section has orange warning styling
- Section contains Report and Block actions
- Block action only shows for other users' content

### 4. Safety Settings Screen (NEW)
**File:** `mobile/lib/screens/safety_settings_screen.dart`

**Screen Structure:**

#### Section A: Blocked Users
- List of blocked users:
  - Avatar
  - Display name
  - Username
  - "Unblock" button
- Search bar to filter blocked users
- Empty state: "No blocked users"
- Tap user → Navigate to profile

#### Section B: Muted Content
**Subsection B.1: Muted Users**

- Empty state: "No muted hashtags"

#### Section C: Content Filters
- Toggle: "Enable default moderation list" (divine's curated NIP-51 list)
- Dropdown: Auto-hide level
  - Options: Info / Warning / Hide / Block
  - Default: Hide
- Toggle: "Show content warnings"
- Link: "Learn about NIP-51 mute lists" → Opens docs

#### Section D: Report History
- List of submitted reports:
  - Date
  - Content type (Video/User)
  - Reason (e.g., "Spam", "Harassment")
  - Status indicator
- Tap report → View details (shows NIP-56 event ID)
- Empty state: "You haven't reported any content"
- "Clear History" button (keeps only last 90 days)

**Widget Test Coverage:**
- All 4 sections render correctly
- Blocked users list shows avatars and usernames
- Muted content sections show appropriate empty states
- Content filter toggles work
- Report history shows submitted reports

### 5. Settings Integration
**File:** `mobile/lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- Add new section header: "Safety & Privacy"
- Add settings tile:
  - Icon: `Icons.shield` (VineTheme.vineGreen)
  - Title: "Safety & Moderation"
  - Subtitle: "Block users, report content, and manage filters"
  - Action: Navigate to SafetySettingsScreen

**Position:** After "Network" section, before app info

**Widget Test Coverage:**
- Safety & Privacy section appears in settings
- Tapping tile navigates to SafetySettingsScreen

- **MuteService**: Mute users, hashtags, keywords, threads
- **ContentBlocklistService**: Internal blocklist management

### No Service Changes Required
All backend services are fully implemented and tested. This is purely a UI/UX enhancement to expose existing functionality.

### New Files to Create
1. `mobile/lib/screens/safety_settings_screen.dart` - Main settings screen
2. `mobile/lib/widgets/moderation_action_sheet.dart` - Bottom sheet for quick actions
3. `mobile/lib/widgets/block_confirmation_dialog.dart` - Reusable block confirmation
4. `mobile/test/widgets/safety_settings_screen_test.dart` - Widget tests
5. `mobile/test/integration/moderation_flow_test.dart` - Integration tests

### Files to Modify
1. `mobile/lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart` - Add flag icon
2. `mobile/lib/screens/profile_screen_router.dart` - Add block button
3. `mobile/lib/widgets/share_video_menu.dart` - Reorganize sections
4. `mobile/lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` - Add safety tile

## UI Specifications

### Colors (Using VineTheme)
- Background: `Colors.black` or `VineTheme.backgroundColor`
- Text: `VineTheme.whiteText`
- Secondary Text: `VineTheme.secondaryText`
- Accent: `VineTheme.vineGreen`

## User Education

### Nostr Protocol Transparency
- Link to NIP-51 docs in Content Filters section
- Show NIP-56 event IDs in Report History
- Explain that blocking is client-side (not protocol-level)
- Note: "They won't be notified" (privacy-preserving)

### Empty States
All lists include helpful empty states:
- "No blocked users" → "Block users to hide their content from your feeds"
- "No muted keywords" → "Mute keywords to filter content"
- "You haven't reported any content" → "Report content that violates policies"

## Success Metrics

### Apple App Store Compliance
- [ ] Report button visible without drilling down
- [ ] Block user functionality clearly accessible
- [ ] Moderation controls in Settings
- [ ] User can manage blocked/muted content

### User Experience
- [ ] Flag icon doesn't clutter video UI
- [ ] Actions are reversible (unblock, unmute)
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs prevent accidents
- [ ] Settings provide full control

### Technical Quality
- [ ] All features have widget tests
- [ ] Integration tests cover end-to-end flows
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing services
- [ ] Dark theme consistency maintained

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Subscribe to external NIP-51 mute lists (backend supports, needs UI)
- Custom content filter rules (advanced users)
- Import/export blocklists
- Sync blocklists across devices via Nostr
- Report analytics (aggregated moderation stats)

## Rollout Plan

1. **Phase 1 (This Design)**: Expose existing moderation features
