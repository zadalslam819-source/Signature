## [Unreleased]

### Changed - Model Deduplication (2026-02-08)

#### Summary
Completed the VGV model migration by eliminating 6 duplicate model classes that existed in both `lib/models/` (app layer) and `packages/models/` (package layer). This resolves type mismatch bugs and reduces maintenance confusion.

#### Deleted (6 app-layer duplicates)
- `lib/models/bug_report_data.dart` — replaced by `package:models`
- `lib/models/log_entry.dart` — replaced by `package:models` (enums unified)
- `lib/models/curation_set.dart` — replaced by `package:models`
- `lib/models/user_profile.dart` + `.g.dart` — replaced by `package:models` + manual Hive adapter + extension methods
- `lib/models/notification_model.dart` — replaced by `package:models` + service-layer converter

#### Created
- `lib/adapters/user_profile_hive_adapter.dart` — manual Hive TypeAdapter (typeId: 3, 13 fields) preserving binary format compatibility with existing caches
- `lib/services/notification_model_converter.dart` — extracted `fromRelayApi()` factory into a service-layer utility function

#### Key Changes
- **Enum unification**: `LogLevel` and `LogCategory` in `unified_logger.dart` now re-export from `package:models` instead of defining duplicates, preserving the `Log` API used by 60+ files
- **UserProfile extensions**: Flutter-dependent getters (`npub`, `truncatedNpub`, `profileBackgroundColor`) remain in `lib/utils/user_profile_utils.dart`; pure getters (`betterDisplayName`, `displayNip05`, `hasProfileBackgroundColor`, `hasBannerImage`) moved to package model
- **Import updates**: ~70 files updated to use `package:models/models.dart` instead of `package:openvine/models/`
- **GoogleFonts test fix**: Bundled `Inter-Medium.ttf` in `google_fonts/` to fix test failures from missing font assets
- **PendingActionService test fix**: Injected fast retry config to prevent 60s timeout in unit tests

#### Documented for Future (Tier 3)
- `PendingUpload` — same migration pattern as UserProfile, deferred due to 30 consumer files
- `VineDraft` — NOT a duplicate (different schemas), requires architectural decision

### Changed - Explore Tab Improvements (2026-01-26)

#### Features
- **Dynamic Classics tab** - Classics tab now only shows when connected to a Funnelcake-enabled relay
  - Tab is completely hidden when Funnelcake API unavailable (no "unavailable" message)
  - Uses `TickerProviderStateMixin` for dynamic TabController rebuilding
  - Tab count changes reactively when switching environments

- **Popular Videos uses trending** - Changed from historical loops to recent engagement
  - Uses `sort=trending` API endpoint instead of `sort=loops`
  - Shows videos with recent likes/engagement, can include both classic and new videos
  - Falls back to supplementing with recent videos if trending returns < 10 results
  - Nostr fallback sorts by `nostrLikeCount` instead of historical `originalLoops`

- **Centralized Funnelcake availability** - Added single source of truth for API availability
  - New `funnelcakeAvailableProvider` in curation_providers.dart
  - All providers watch this instead of checking individually
  - Invalidates automatically when environment changes

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/screens/explore_screen.dart`:
  - Dynamic `_tabCount` getter (3 or 4 based on availability)
  - Watch `classicVinesAvailableProvider` and rebuild TabController on change
  - Conditional tabs and TabBarView children using `if (_classicsAvailable)`

- Modified `lib/providers/popular_videos_feed_provider.dart`:
  - Changed from `getVideosByLoops()` to `getTrendingVideos()`
  - Added fallback to supplement with `getRecentVideos()` if trending < 10 videos
  - Nostr fallback sorts by likes instead of loops

- Modified `lib/providers/curation_providers.dart`:
  - Added `funnelcakeAvailableProvider` with 30-second cache timeout
  - Added `classicVinesAvailableProvider` that delegates to Funnelcake check

### Fixed - Relay Management Improvements (2026-01-24)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Allow removing default relay** - Users can now remove any relay including the environment default from relay settings
  - Previously `RelayManager` silently refused to remove the default relay
  - UI now checks the removal result and shows appropriate feedback
- **Refresh feeds when relay set changes** - Adding or removing relays now triggers a feed reset so content from the new relay configuration is fetched
  - New `relaySetChangeBridge` Riverpod provider watches for relay URL set membership changes
  - 2-second debounce collapses rapid add/remove operations into a single refresh
  - Only reacts to set changes (relays added/removed), not connection state flapping
  - Persistent feeds (home feed, discovery) are automatically resubscribed; ephemeral feeds (search, hashtag) are cleared and re-created on next navigation

#### Technical Details
- Modified `packages/nostr_client/lib/src/relay_manager.dart`:
  - Removed guard preventing default relay removal
- Modified `lib/screens/relay_settings_screen.dart`:
  - Check `removeRelay()` return value before showing success
- Modified `lib/services/video_event_service.dart`:
  - Store `sortBy` and `nip50Sort` in `_subscriptionParams` for resubscription
  - Added `resetAndResubscribeAll()` method: snapshots persistent feed params, cancels subscriptions, clears events/pagination/buckets, resubscribes with `force: true`
- Modified `lib/providers/app_providers.dart`:
  - Added `relaySetChangeBridge` keepAlive provider that listens to `relayStatusStream`, compares URL set, debounces 2s, calls `resetAndResubscribeAll()`
- Modified `lib/router/app_shell.dart`:
  - Activated bridge with `ref.watch(relaySetChangeBridgeProvider)`

#### Tests Added
- `test/unit/services/video_event_service_reset_resubscribe_test.dart` - 8 tests covering reset behavior, listener notifications, resubscription of persistent feeds, ephemeral feed handling, and disposed state
- `test/unit/providers/relay_set_change_bridge_test.dart` - 6 tests covering relay add/remove detection, connection flapping no-op, debounce behavior, and empty initial state

### Changed - REST API Pagination with Funnelcake (2025-01-14)

#### Features
- **Funnelcake REST API first, Nostr fallback** - All video feeds now try the Funnelcake REST API first for better performance, falling back to Nostr subscriptions if unavailable
  - HomeFeedProvider: Fetches personalized feed from `/api/users/{pubkey}/feed`
  - ProfileFeedProvider: Fetches user videos from `/api/users/{pubkey}/videos`
  - PopularNowFeedProvider: Fetches recent videos from `/api/videos`

- **Cursor-based pagination** - Fixed pagination to use proper cursor-based approach with `before` timestamp parameter instead of increasing limit
  - Each `loadMore()` call passes the oldest video timestamp as cursor
  - Prevents duplicate videos and ensures consistent pagination

- **Localhost Funnelcake support** - Added new Dev environment option for local testing
  - Relay URL: `ws://localhost:8080`
  - API URL: `http://localhost:8080`
  - Access via Settings → Developer Options → Dev - Localhost

- Updated `test/providers/popular_now_feed_provider_test.dart` with descriptive skip messages

### Fixed - NIP-22 Comment Compliance (2026-01-14)

#### Critical Bug Fix
- **Comments now use Kind 1111 (NIP-22) instead of Kind 1** - Per Nostr protocol, comments on non-Kind-1 content must use Kind 1111
  - SocialService: `postComment()`, `fetchCommentsForEvent()`, `getCommentCount()` now use Kind 1111
  - NotificationService: Comment subscription now filters for Kind 1111
  - CommentsRepository (package) was already correct - uses Kind 1111 with proper NIP-22 threading

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/services/social_service.dart`:

- Modified `lib/services/notification_service_enhanced.dart`:
  - Changed `_subscribeToComments()` to filter for `EventKind.comment` (1111)
- Modified `lib/services/notification_helpers.dart`:
  - Changed `extractVideoEventId()` to look for uppercase 'E' tag first (NIP-22 root scope)
  - Falls back to lowercase 'e' tag for reactions, reposts, and legacy events
- Modified `test/unit/services/social_service_comment_test.dart`:
  - Updated all test expectations to use Kind 1111
- Modified `test/services/notification_helpers_test.dart`:
  - Added tests for NIP-22 uppercase 'E' tag extraction

### Fixed - Nostr Publish Reliability (2025-12-21)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Added 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (2s, 4s delays)
  - Auto-initializes NostrClient before publish if not connected
  - Force reconnects all relays before publish to handle stale WebSocket connections

- **Fixed concurrent modification crash** - App no longer crashes during relay initialization
  - Root cause: `_configuredRelays` list was being modified while being iterated during async operations
  - Fix: Create a copy of the list before iterating in `_connectToConfiguredRelays()` and `forceReconnectAll()`

- **Clear studio after successful publish** - Clips are now cleared from ClipManager after video is published
  - Prevents accidentally re-publishing the same clips

#### Technical Details
- Modified `packages/nostr_client/lib/src/relay_manager.dart`:
  - Added `forceReconnectAll()` method to disconnect and reconnect all relays
  - Fixed concurrent modification by using `List<String>.from(_configuredRelays)` before async iteration
- Modified `packages/nostr_client/lib/src/nostr_client.dart`:
  - Added `forceReconnectAll()` method delegating to RelayManager

### Fixed - Clip Library Navigation and UI (2025-12-20)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed clip library multi-select UI** - Restored circular checkboxes and "Create Video" FAB that were lost during merge
  - Users can now select multiple clips and navigate to Clip Manager
  - Selection shows green circular checkmarks instead of square boxes

- **Fixed navigation dead-end errors** - Changed `go()` to `push()` for clip navigation
  - Camera → Clips now uses `push` to preserve back navigation
  - Clips → Clip Manager now uses `push` to preserve back navigation
  - Profile → Clips now uses `push` to preserve back navigation
  - Previously caused GoRouter error: "You have popped the last page off of the stack"

- **Fixed delete confirmation being bypassed** - Delete now shows confirmation dialog
  - Long press on clip shows preview sheet with delete icon
  - Tapping delete icon shows "Delete Clip?" confirmation dialog

- **Fixed session grouping for clips with null sessionId** - `getClipsBySession('ungrouped')` now correctly returns clips without a session

#### Technical Details

  - Fixed `getClipsBySession('ungrouped')` to return clips with null sessionId

### Fixed - macOS Camera and Video Processing (2025-12-20)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed macOS camera dispose crash** - App no longer crashes when camera is disposed during configuration
  - Root cause: `stopRunning()` was being called on AVCaptureSession between `beginConfiguration()` and `commitConfiguration()` calls
  - Fix: Only call `stopRunning()` if session is actually running, and run on background queue
  - Crash message was: `stopRunning may not be called between calls to beginConfiguration and commitConfiguration`

- **Investigation: macOS multi-clip navigation hang** - Added debug mode to skip cropping on macOS for testing
  - When recording multiple clips with vertical crop on macOS, navigation to VideoEditorScreen would hang
  - The navigation push fires (observer sees didPush) but the widget never builds
  - Added temporary debug flag to skip crop encoding and test if that's the root cause
  - iOS continues to work normally with cropping enabled

#### Technical Details
- Modified `macos/NativeCameraPlugin.swift`:
  - `dispose()` method now checks `session.isRunning` before calling `stopRunning()`
  - Runs `stopRunning()` on background queue to avoid blocking main thread
- Modified `lib/services/video_export_service.dart`:

- **Improved Camera Screen**
  - Shows clip count during recording ("1 clip", "2 clips", etc.)
  - Clear/reset button to discard recorded clips
  - Mute audio toggle during recording
  - Better aspect ratio handling through recording pipeline

#### Bug Fixes

### Fixed - Cache JSON Corruption Crash (2025-12-13)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed app crash when cache JSON is corrupted** - App would crash with FormatException when cache metadata JSON file was empty or malformed (e.g., due to app crash during write)
  - Added `SafeJsonCacheInfoRepository` wrapper that catches FormatException and recovers gracefully
  - Deletes corrupted cache file and retries with fresh cache
  - Also handles malformed JSON in Nostr events database tags

#### Technical Details
- Added `lib/services/safe_json_cache_repository.dart`:
  - Wraps `JsonCacheInfoRepository` from flutter_cache_manager
  - Catches FormatException on `open()` and deletes corrupted JSON from `getApplicationSupportDirectory()`
  - Note: Cache metadata JSON is stored in app support dir, not temp dir (where cached files go)
- Modified `lib/services/video_cache_manager.dart` and `lib/services/image_cache_manager.dart`:
  - Use `SafeJsonCacheInfoRepository` instead of default repository
- Modified `lib/database/daos/nostr_events_dao.dart`:
  - Added try-catch around `jsonDecode` for event tags to prevent crash on malformed data

- **Fixed black screen of death when saving profile edits** - Navigation crash occurred when the edit-profile route became the root route
  - Changed from Flutter Navigator to GoRouter's `context.pop()` for consistency
  - Added `context.canPop()` check before attempting to pop
  - If can't pop (route is root), gracefully navigates to home with `context.go('/')` instead of crashing

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/screens/profile_setup_screen.dart`:
  - Success path (line ~1165): Use GoRouter `context.canPop()` and `context.pop()` with fallback to `context.go('/')`
  - Error path (line ~1212): Same defensive navigation pattern

### Fixed - macOS Segment Recording and Upload (2025-12-01)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed macOS multi-segment recording failing to upload** - Videos were being rejected with "duration_exceeded" because pauses between segments were included in the final video
  - Implemented FFmpeg segment extraction to include only actively recorded portions
  - Removed AVFoundation wall-clock duration limit (users can take unlimited time between segments)
  - Fixed `hasSegments` state propagation from controller to UI for correct progress bar display

#### Technical Details
- Modified `macos/NativeCameraPlugin.swift`:
  - Set `maxRecordedDuration = CMTime.invalid` to disable native wall-clock limit
  - Virtual segments tracked in Flutter enforce the actual 6-second content limit
- Modified `lib/services/vine_recording_controller.dart`:
  - Added `_extractMacOSSegments()` method for FFmpeg-based segment extraction
  - Uses `-ss` (start offset) and `-t` (duration) to extract each virtual segment
  - Concatenates multiple segments if needed, applies aspect ratio crop
  - Updated `finishRecording()` for macOS single recording mode
- Modified `lib/providers/vine_recording_provider.dart`:
  - Fixed `updateState()` to preserve `cameraSwitchCount` for UI rebuilds

### Fixed - Video Processing Status Message (2025-11-28)

  - Previously, the processing flag was set too late (after FFmpeg finished), causing the wrong message
  - Now sets processing state immediately when stop recording is triggered
  - Proper error handling resets processing state on failure

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/screens/pure/universal_camera_screen_pure.dart`:
  - Set `_isProcessing = true` at start of `_stopRecording()` before calling provider
  - Provider's `stopRecording()` auto-calls `finishRecording()` which runs FFmpeg
  - Added navigation to metadata screen after draft auto-creation
  - Added proper cleanup with `finally` block to reset processing state

### Fixed - Blossom Upload Authentication (2025-11-27)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Improved Blossom BUD-01 authentication compliance** - Fixed auth event construction for better compatibility with Blossom media servers
  - Added missing `size` tag to auth event (required by some servers for validation)
  - Confirmed standard base64 encoding (not base64url) per BUD-01 specification
  - Added explicit `Content-Length` header to upload requests
  - Added debug logging for auth event JSON to aid troubleshooting

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/services/blossom_upload_service.dart`:
  - Added `size` tag to auth event tags list: `['size', fileSize.toString()]`
  - Added `Content-Length` header to upload request headers
  - Added X-Reason header check for detailed error information from server
  - Added debug logging to print auth event JSON before encoding
  - Comment clarification: BUD-01 requires standard base64 encoding (not base64url)

### Fixed - Expiring Post Safety & Multiple Imeta Parsing (2025-11-25)

#### Safety Improvements
- **Added confirmation dialog for expiring posts** - Users must now explicitly confirm before enabling post expiration
  - Shows warning that video will be "permanently deleted from Nostr relays"
  - Warns "This action cannot be undone. Once expired, the video will be gone forever."
  - Requires clicking "Yes, Make It Expire" to enable (prevents accidental expiration)
  - Double-check safety: expiration tag only added if both toggle AND confirmation are true

#### Bug Fixes (Postel's Law)
- **Fixed video URL selection from multiple imeta tags** - Now correctly selects best working URL when events have multiple imeta tags with mixed working/broken URLs
  - Added handling for `hls`, `dash`, `stream`, `streaming`, `fallback`, `mp4`, `video` keys in imeta
  - Deprioritized known broken URL pattern: `cdn.divine.video/*/manifest/video.m3u8` (score: 5)
  - Prioritized reliable sources: direct MP4 from cdn.divine.video (115), stream.divine.video HLS (105)
  - Ensures working URLs from first imeta tag aren't overridden by broken URLs from second imeta tag

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/screens/pure/video_metadata_screen_pure.dart`:
  - Added `_expirationConfirmed` flag
  - Added `_showExpirationConfirmationDialog()` method
  - Updated switch handler to show confirmation before enabling

  - Added contextTitle-aware positioning in VideoOverlayActions
  - Username/follow chip now positioned 80px below top when list header present
  - Applies to both UserListPeopleScreen and CuratedListFeedScreen

### Fixed - Video Playback on Navigation (2025-11-24)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed videos continuing to play during navigation** - Videos now properly stop/pause when navigating away via Navigator.push
  - VideoStopNavigatorObserver only catches GoRouter navigation, not raw Navigator.push calls
  - Added explicit video cleanup before: opening comments, camera, lists, drawer screens
  - Videos stop when exiting video mode back to grid in list screens

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart`: Pause video before opening comments

- Relays SHOULD delete all events from the user's pubkey
- Relays MAY retain signed deletion request for compliance
- No guarantees about relay compliance (protocol limitation)

#### User Experience
- Clear communication about deletion permanence
- Honest disclosure about relay compliance variability
- No false promises of complete erasure
- Quick 3-tap flow: Settings → Delete Account → Confirm
- Minimal friction for legitimate deletion requests

### Fixed - Comments Loading (2025-11-08)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed infinite loading spinner in comments screen** - Comments now load immediately instead of waiting up to 2 minutes
  - Root cause: CommentsProvider used blocking `await for` loop to consume Nostr event stream
  - Nostr relays may never send EOSE (End Of Stored Events), causing 2-minute timeout waits
  - Solution: Replaced with reactive `stream.listen()` + Completer pattern
  - UI updates immediately as each comment event arrives
  - Shows "Classic Vine" message immediately when no comments exist
  - Shows empty state promptly instead of waiting for stream completion

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/providers/comments_provider.dart`:
  - Replaced blocking `await for` with reactive `stream.listen()`
  - Added `Completer<void>` to track stream completion for proper async behavior
  - Sets `isLoading = false` after first event or when stream completes with no events
  - Added `dart:async` import for Completer
  - Updates UI reactively via state updates in event handler
  - Maintains proper cleanup with `ref.onDispose()` for subscription cancellation

#### Test Coverage
- All 13 comments provider tests pass
- No new analyzer issues introduced
- Verified all other Nostr stream consumers already use correct reactive patterns

### Added - Video Buffering & UX Improvements (2025-11-08)

#### Features
- **Added video buffering to prevent jarring auto-updates** - New videos buffer while browsing
  - New videos arriving via Nostr subscriptions are buffered instead of auto-inserting
  - Shows banner with count of buffered videos
  - User can tap banner to load buffered videos at top of feed
  - Buffering enabled when browsing Explore tabs, disabled when hidden
  - Prevents feed jumping while user is watching videos

- **Added pull-to-refresh on Explore tabs** - Refresh Popular Now, Trending, and Editor's Pick
  - Pull down gesture refreshes current tab
  - Shows loading indicator during refresh
  - Invalidates and reloads appropriate provider (videoEventsProvider or curationProvider)

- **Renamed "Trending" to "Popular Vines"** - More descriptive tab name in Explore screen

- **Added followers/following screen navigation** - New routes for social graph views

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/providers/video_events_providers.dart`:
  - Added buffering state management with `_bufferedEvents` list
  - Added `enableBuffering()` / `disableBuffering()` methods
  - Added `loadBufferedVideos()` to flush buffer into main feed
  - Added `bufferedCount` getter for banner display
  - Created `bufferedVideoCountProvider` for reactive count updates

- Modified `lib/screens/explore_screen.dart`:
  - Added `_buildNewVideosBanner()` widget for buffered videos indicator
  - Added `onRefresh` callback to ComposableVideoGrid
  - Integrated buffering enable/disable in screen lifecycle (onScreenVisible/onScreenHidden)

### Added - Mutual Mute Blocking (2025-11-08)

#### Features
- **Added mutual mute list blocking (NIP-51 kind 10000)** - Reciprocally hide content from users who mute you
  - Background sync of kind 10000 events tagging your pubkey
  - Automatic filtering of mutual muters across all feeds (home, discovery, hashtag, search, comments)
  - "This account is not available" message when navigating to blocked user's profile or video
  - Persistent storage via embedded relay's SQLite between sessions
  - Non-blocking startup - runs as low priority background process

#### Technical Details
- Created comprehensive design document: `docs/plans/2025-11-08-mutual-mute-blocking-design.md`
- Extended `lib/services/content_blocklist_service.dart`:
  - Added `_mutualMuteBlocklist` Set for tracking mutual muters
  - Added `syncMuteListsInBackground()` method to subscribe to kind 10000 events
  - Added `_handleMuteListEvent()` to process mute/unmute events
  - Modified `shouldFilterFromFeeds()` to check all three blocklists
  - Handles replaceable events (unmuting when user removes you from their list)
- Modified `lib/main.dart`:
  - Integrated mutual mute sync into app startup via `Future.microtask()`
  - Runs after AuthService ready but before feeds load
  - Graceful error handling for non-critical feature
- Modified `lib/screens/profile_screen_router.dart`:

  - 11 comprehensive tests for mutual mute functionality
  - Tests subscription creation, event handling, unmuting, and filtering
  - All tests passing
- Uses mock NostrService and StreamControllers for async testing

### Added - Advanced Share Menu (2025-11-08)

#### Features
- **Added developer/power-user features to share menu** - View source and copy event IDs
  - New "Advanced" section in video share menu
  - "View Source" shows raw Nostr event JSON in dialog
  - "Copy Event ID" copies full Nostr event ID to clipboard
  - Pretty-printed JSON with syntax highlighting
  - Copy entire JSON or just event ID

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/widgets/share_video_menu.dart`:
  - Added `_buildAdvancedSection()` with View Source and Copy Event ID options
  - Created `_ViewSourceDialog` widget for displaying event JSON
  - Added `_showViewSourceDialog()` and `_copyEventId()` methods
  - Uses `JsonEncoder.withIndent()` for readable formatting
  - Fetches raw event from NostrService via `fetchEventById()`

### Fixed - Database Migration Resilience (2025-11-08)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed video_metrics backfill migration to handle malformed events** - Migration now completes successfully even with bad data
  - Changed from `INSERT` to `INSERT OR IGNORE` to skip events with invalid tags
  - Added NULL checks before CAST operations to prevent SQL errors
  - Added logging for backfill success rate (shows X/Y events backfilled)
  - Wrapped backfill in try-catch to prevent migration failure
  - Empty video_metrics table is acceptable - new events will populate going forward

#### Root Cause
- Some events have malformed tag structures or missing tag values
- Direct CAST operations threw SQL errors on NULL values
- Migration would fail completely, preventing app startup
- Users stuck on old schema version

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/database/app_database.dart`:
  - Lines 90-180: Updated migration step 2 backfill logic
  - Added CASE/WHEN checks before CAST operations
  - Added event count logging before/after backfill
  - Added comprehensive error handling with stack traces
  - Migration completes successfully even if backfill fails
  - Future events still get metrics via `upsertEvent()`

### Fixed - Relay Migration (2025-10-31)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Added automatic migration from relay3.openvine.co to relay.divine.video**
  - Root cause: Embedded relay stores external relay URLs persistently across app sessions
  - Symptom: Users who installed before relay change continued using old relay despite code updates
  - Impact: Users' settings showed relay.divine.video but app connected to relay3.openvine.co
  - Solution: Added migration logic to detect and remove old relay on startup

#### Files Modified
- `lib/services/nostr_service.dart` - Added migration check before relay connection
- `lib/services/nostr_service_function.dart` - Added migration check for function-channel variant

#### Technical Details
- Migration runs on every app startup before relay connection loop
- Checks if `relay3.openvine.co` is in embedded relay's connected relays list
- If found, calls `removeExternalRelay()` to clean up old configuration
- Normal initialization then adds new default relay from `AppConstants.defaultRelayUrl`
- Idempotent operation (safe to run multiple times)
- Zero overhead if user doesn't have old relay configured
- Pattern can be extended for future relay migrations

### Fixed - Video Grid Thumbnail Layout (2025-10-25)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed video thumbnails being squished in explore grid**
  - Root cause: Grid used `childAspectRatio: 1.0` (square) for entire tile including video + labels
  - This made video thumbnails appear horizontally compressed
  - Symptom: Video thumbnails were not square, labels were inside the square tile
  - Solution: Force video to square aspect ratio, adjust grid tile to be vertical rectangle

#### Files Modified
- `lib/widgets/composable_video_grid.dart` - Changed layout structure and aspect ratios

#### Technical Details
- Replaced `Expanded(flex: 5)` with `AspectRatio(aspectRatio: 1.0)` to force video thumbnails square
- Added `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` to Column to only take needed space
- Adjusted `childAspectRatio` from `1.0` to `0.85` (vertical rectangle tiles)
- Video thumbnail is now guaranteed 1:1 square, labels appear cleanly below
- Removed excess blank space under stats by optimizing tile height
- Added `StringUtils.formatCompactNumber()` for likes/loops display (shows 1K, 1M instead of raw numbers)

### Fixed - Explore Feed Sort Order Mismatch (2025-10-25)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed video playback issues caused by sort order mismatch between grid and feed**
  - Root cause: ExploreScreen grid used tab-specific sorting (New Vines=date, Trending=loops) but activeVideoIdProvider used default loop-count sorting
  - Symptom 1: Videos wouldn't play when tapped in grid
  - Symptom 2: Wrong video would play (tapping New Vines video played Trending video)
  - Symptom 3: Feed displayed different order than grid (confusing UX)
  - Solution: Created shared state provider to synchronize video lists across all components

#### Files Modified
- `lib/providers/route_feed_providers.dart` - Added exploreTabVideosProvider and legacy Riverpod import
- `lib/providers/active_video_provider.dart` - Added debug logging for troubleshooting
- `lib/screens/explore_screen.dart` - Set/clear tab videos provider on enter/exit feed mode
- `lib/screens/pure/explore_video_screen_pure.dart` - Use tab-specific list from parent

#### Technical Details
- Created `exploreTabVideosProvider` (StateProvider) to hold tab-specific sorted video lists
- ExploreScreen sets this provider when entering feed mode with the grid's sorted list
- videosForExploreRouteProvider uses tab list when available, falls back to loop-count sorting
- activeVideoIdProvider uses videosForExploreRouteProvider, now containing correct tab list
- All three components (grid, feed UI, active video logic) now use same sorted list
- Requires `import 'package:flutter_riverpod/legacy.dart'` for StateProvider in Riverpod 3.0
- Ensures New Vines maintains date sort, Trending maintains loop sort, Editor's Pick maintains curation

### Fixed - NIP-71 imeta Tag Parsing (2025-10-25)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed video URL extraction from new imeta tag format**
  - Root cause: imeta tag format changed from space-separated key-value pairs to positional pairs
  - OLD FORMAT: `["imeta", "url https://...", "m video/mp4"]` (space within element)
  - NEW FORMAT: `["imeta", "url", "https://...", "m", "video/mp4"]` (separate elements)
  - Parser only supported old format, causing video URLs to not be extracted
  - Database had 1953 events but only 2 displayed because URLs weren't being parsed
  - Now supports BOTH formats for backward compatibility

#### Files Modified
- `lib/models/video_event.dart` - Updated `_parseImetaTag()` to handle both imeta formats

#### Technical Details
- Parser now detects format by checking if first element contains a space
- OLD FORMAT: Loop through elements, split on space to get key-value pairs
- NEW FORMAT: Loop in steps of 2, treat consecutive elements as key-value pairs
- Fixes issue where 1953 events in database appeared as "no videos" in explore feed
- Enables proper video display from relay.divine.video and other relays using new format

### Fixed - Video Display Crash (2025-10-25)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed "Invalid argument(s): 0" crash preventing videos from displaying**
  - Root cause: `clamp(0, videos.length - 1)` when `videos.length` is 0 produces `clamp(0, -1)` which throws error
  - Previously calculated clamp before checking if videos list was empty
  - Now checks for empty videos first, only calculates clamp when videos exist
  - Prevents crash when home feed is loading or has no videos

#### Files Modified
- `lib/screens/home_screen_router.dart` - Reordered empty check before clamp calculation

#### Technical Details
- Moved `urlIndex = (ctx.videoIndex ?? 0).clamp(0, videos.length - 1)` to AFTER empty videos check
- When videos is empty, sets `urlIndex = 0` and displays "No videos available" UI
- When videos exist, safely clamps index because `videos.length - 1 >= 0`
- Fix resolves issue where NostrService was successfully fetching events but UI crashed before displaying them

### Fixed - Trending Hashtags Fallback (2025-10-25)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Added fallback default hashtags when analytics API is unavailable**
  - Root cause: Backend `/analytics/trending/hashtags` endpoint doesn't exist (returns 404)
  - Previously returned empty list when API failed, showing no hashtags to users
  - Now falls back to curated list from `HashtagExtractor.suggestedHashtags`
  - Provides 20 default trending hashtags: openvine, nostr, vine, funny, art, dance, music, comedy, etc.
  - Fallback hashtags include placeholder stats (views, video count, viral score) for consistent UI

#### Files Modified
- `lib/services/analytics_api_service.dart` - Added `_getDefaultTrendingHashtags()` fallback method
- Changed error behavior from returning `[]` to returning default hashtags
- Changed log level from ERROR to WARNING when API is unavailable (expected condition)

#### Technical Details
- Default hashtags generated from `HashtagExtractor.suggestedHashtags` list
- Maintains consistent UI experience even when backend API is down
- Stats decrease naturally (1000→550 views, 50→12 videos) to simulate trending order
- Fallback is transparent to UI - same `TrendingHashtag` object structure

### Changed - Default Relay (2025-10-25)

#### Configuration Changes
- **Changed default Nostr relay from `wss://relay3.openvine.co` to `wss://relay.divine.video`**
  - Centralized relay URL in `AppConstants.defaultRelayUrl` constant
  - Updated all service files to use the constant instead of hardcoded URLs
  - Ensures consistency across native app, web version, and background scripts

#### Files Modified
- `lib/constants/app_constants.dart` - Added `defaultRelayUrl` constant
- `lib/services/nostr_service.dart` - Uses `AppConstants.defaultRelayUrl`
- `lib/services/nostr_service_web.dart` - Uses `AppConstants.defaultRelayUrl`
- `lib/services/nostr_service_function.dart` - Uses `AppConstants.defaultRelayUrl`
- `lib/services/analytics_api_service.dart` - Uses `AppConstants.defaultRelayUrl`
- `lib/scripts/bulk_thumbnail_generator.dart` - Uses `AppConstants.defaultRelayUrl`

#### Technical Benefits
- Single source of truth for default relay configuration
- Easier to update relay URL in future (change one constant)
- Consistent relay usage across all app implementations
- No more scattered hardcoded relay URLs throughout codebase

### Fixed - iOS Build Failure (2025-10-25)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed iOS build failing with "No podspec found for wakelock_plus"**
  - Root cause: Stale explicit pod reference in `ios/Podfile` for plugin that was never actually a dependency
  - Someone had manually added `pod 'wakelock_plus'` to Podfile, causing CocoaPods to fail
  - The `flutter_install_all_ios_pods` command already handles all actual plugin dependencies automatically
  - Fixed by removing the explicit wakelock_plus line from Podfile (line 43)
  - iOS release builds now complete successfully and can be distributed via TestFlight

#### Technical Details
- Modified `ios/Podfile`:
  - Removed explicit `pod 'wakelock_plus', :path => '.symlinks/plugins/wakelock_plus/ios'` line
  - Kept `pod 'libwebp'` which is still required
  - Flutter's auto-generated plugin list handles all actual dependencies

### Fixed - Critical Log Export Bug (2025-10-21)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed log export capturing only 25 lines instead of thousands** - Category filtering was incorrectly applied to file capture
  - Root cause: Logger was filtering logs by category BEFORE writing to persistent storage
  - Default categories (only `system` and `auth`) meant 90% of logs were discarded
  - Critical debugging logs (`relay`, `video`, `ui`, `api`, `storage`) were never saved to files
  - Users exporting logs for support received only 25 lines instead of 2,200+ lines

  - Fixed by separating console output filtering from file capture:
    - Console output: Still filtered by category/level (reduces development noise)
    - File capture: ALWAYS happens regardless of category or level settings
    - Ensures comprehensive diagnostic data for debugging remote user issues

  - Impact: Log exports now include ALL categories for complete debugging context
    - Before: 25 lines, only `system`/`auth` categories, 0.00 MB
    - After: 2,200+ lines, ALL categories (relay: 116, video: 319, ui: 132, etc.), 0.18 MB
    - **88x more logs** with full relay connection debugging information

- **Fixed relay diagnostic network test using port 0** - WebSocket URLs now use correct default ports
  - `wss://` URLs now correctly use port 443 (not 0)
  - `ws://` URLs now correctly use port 80 (not 0)
  - `uri.port` returns 0 when port not explicitly specified in URL
  - Fixed by checking `uri.hasPort` and using scheme-appropriate defaults

#### Test Coverage
- Created `test/unit/utils/unified_logger_test.dart`:
  - 5 comprehensive tests following TDD methodology
  - Tests verified failing before fix, passing after fix
  - Tests log capture independence from category/level filtering
  - Tests all categories captured (relay, video, ui, api, storage, system, auth)
  - Tests all log levels captured (verbose, debug, info, warning, error)
  - Tests real-world bug report export scenario

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/utils/unified_logger.dart`:
  - Separated console filtering from file capture in `_log()` method
  - Console output uses `shouldPrintToConsole` check (filtered by category/level)
  - File capture happens unconditionally for ALL logs
  - Added comprehensive comments explaining the separation

- Modified `lib/screens/relay_diagnostic_screen.dart`:
  - Fixed `_testNetworkConnectivity()` port selection logic
  - Uses `uri.hasPort` to detect explicit port vs default
  - Applies correct default ports: 443 for wss://, 80 for ws://

### Fixed - Hashtag Navigation and Event Deduplication (2025-10-17)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed hashtag navigation from search removing search screen** - Hashtag now pushes on navigation stack
  - Search screen previously disappeared when tapping hashtag (used GoRouter's `go()` method)
  - Changed to `Navigator.push()` to keep search in the stack
  - Back button now correctly returns to search results
  - Hashtag screen shows proper AppBar with back button
- **Fixed hashtag feeds not showing videos after search** - Removed global event deduplication
  - Events seen in search were dropped as "globally-duplicate" when hashtag subscription tried to deliver them
  - Removed `_rememberGlobalEvent()` global deduplication logic from NostrService
  - Per-subscription deduplication (via `seenEventIds` Set) prevents duplicates within same subscription
  - Same event can now appear in different contexts (search results, hashtag feed, home feed)
  - Relay queries successfully but events were being dropped at service layer

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/screens/pure/search_screen_pure.dart`:
  - Lines 521-543: Changed hashtag tap handler to use `Navigator.push()` with `MaterialPageRoute`
  - Added import for `HashtagScreenRouter`
  - Hashtag screen wrapped in Scaffold with AppBar for proper back navigation
- Modified `lib/services/nostr_service.dart`:
  - Lines 363-366: Removed global deduplication check, replaced with explanatory comment
  - Removed lines 440-450: Deleted `_rememberGlobalEvent()` method entirely
  - Removed lines 38-41: Deleted global deduplication state (`_recentEventQueue`, `_recentEventSet`)
  - Removed unused `dart:collection` import
  - Per-subscription deduplication retained (line 313: `seenEventIds` Set per subscription)

#### Tests
- Created `test/screens/search_hashtag_navigation_test.dart`:
  - Tests that tapping hashtag from search results uses Navigator.push (keeps search in stack)

### Fixed - Tab Visibility Listener for Video Clearing (2025-10-13)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Added tab visibility listeners to clear active video when switching tabs** - Prevents video playback in background tabs
  - `MainScreen` now listens for tab changes and clears active video when navigating away from video feeds
  - Ensures videos stop playing when user switches to Profile, Camera, or Explore tabs
  - Uses `_currentTabIndex` tracking to detect tab navigation events
  - Calls `VideoOverlayManager.clearActiveVideo()` on tab switches away from video content

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/screens/main_screen.dart`:
  - Added tab visibility tracking in `_onTabSelected()` method
  - Detects navigation away from Home and Explore tabs (indices 0 and 2)
  - Clears active video controller to stop background playback
  - Logs tab changes for debugging video lifecycle issues

### Added - Phase 1 App Lifecycle Video Pause Tests (2025-10-13)

  - Tests observer registration in VideoOverlayManager
  - Validates video pause when app enters background (AppLifecycleState.paused)
  - Confirms video resume when app returns to foreground (AppLifecycleState.resumed)
  - Tests cleanup on VideoOverlayManager disposal
  - Uses proper async/await patterns for lifecycle state changes

### Fixed - Video Playback During Camera Recording (2025-10-08)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed videos playing in background during camera recording** - Videos now fully disposed when opening camera
  - `VideoStopNavigatorObserver` now detects camera screen navigation and disposes all video controllers
  - Previous behavior only cleared active video, allowing background playback to continue
  - Camera screen navigation now triggers `VideoOverlayManager.disposeAllControllers()`
  - Ensures complete cleanup of video state when entering camera mode

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/services/video_stop_navigator_observer.dart`:
  - Added import for `video_overlay_manager_provider.dart`
  - Lines 27-44: Added camera screen detection logic
  - Checks if route name contains "Camera" to identify camera navigation
  - Calls `disposeAllControllers()` for camera routes vs `clearActiveVideo()` for other routes
  - Logs differentiate between disposal actions for debugging

### Fixed - iOS Camera Permissions on Fresh App Launch (2025-10-08)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed iOS camera permission detection on fresh app launch** - Permissions now correctly detected without requiring Settings visit
  - iOS `permission_handler` plugin has persistent caching bug that returns stale status across app launches
  - Solution: Bypass `permission_handler` entirely, attempt camera initialization directly
  - Native `AVCaptureDevice` checks real system permissions, not cached values
  - Works correctly for both returning from Settings AND fresh app launches

#### Root Cause
- `permission_handler` caches permission status in memory and persists it across app sessions
- Even after granting permissions in Settings, `Permission.camera.status` returns stale `false` value
- Calling `.request()` also returns cached status instead of checking actual system state
- Only way to get accurate status is to let native AVFoundation attempt initialization

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/screens/pure/universal_camera_screen_pure.dart`:
  - Lines 175-238: Updated `_performAsyncInitialization()` to bypass `permission_handler`
  - Attempts camera initialization first before checking cached permission status
  - If initialization succeeds → permissions already granted
  - If initialization fails with permission error → request permissions via dialog
  - After granting → retry initialization
  - Lines 84-135: Previously fixed `_recheckPermissions()` for Settings return flow

#### Manual Testing Protocol
- Fresh app launch with permissions already granted: Camera preview appears immediately
- Fresh app launch without permissions: Permission dialog appears, camera initializes after grant
- Returning from Settings after granting: Camera preview appears immediately (already fixed)
- No longer requires visiting Settings on every app launch

### Fixed - Thumbnail Generation on macOS (2025-10-08)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed video thumbnail generation on macOS** - Hybrid approach ensures cross-platform compatibility
  - Primary strategy: `fc_native_video_thumbnail` plugin (fast, native performance)
  - Fallback strategy: FFmpeg (universal, works on ALL platforms)
  - macOS previously failed with `MissingPluginException` from plugin
  - Now successfully generates thumbnails via FFmpeg fallback

#### Implementation
- Modified `lib/services/video_thumbnail_service.dart`:
  - Lines 98-125: Try `fc_native_video_thumbnail` first
  - Lines 127-136: Fallback to FFmpeg on plugin failure
  - Lines 20-67: Added `_extractThumbnailWithFFmpeg()` method
  - FFmpeg command: Extract frame at 100ms, resize to 640x640, JPEG quality 2

#### Platform Support Matrix
| Platform | fc_native_video_thumbnail | FFmpeg | Result |
|----------|--------------------------|--------|--------|
| Android  | ✅ Works                 | ✅ Available | Uses plugin |
| iOS      | ✅ Works                 | ✅ Available | Uses plugin |
| macOS    | ❌ MissingPluginException | ✅ Works | Uses FFmpeg |
| Windows  | ✅ Should work           | ✅ Available | Uses plugin or FFmpeg |
| Linux    | ❓ Unknown              | ✅ Works | Uses FFmpeg |

#### Test Results
- Unit tests: 17/17 PASS (`test/services/video_thumbnail_service_test.dart`)
- Integration tests: 8/8 PASS (`test/services/video_event_publisher_embedded_thumbnail_test.dart`)
- E2E tests: 3/3 PASS (`test/integration/video_thumbnail_publish_e2e_test.dart`)

#### Documentation
- Created `THUMBNAIL_SOLUTION.md` with comprehensive implementation details
- Includes FFmpeg command reference, testing protocol, and future improvements

### Fixed - Home Feed Empty State (2025-10-04)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed home feed showing empty state despite following users with videos** - Resolved provider disposal race condition
  - Changed `socialProvider` from `keepAlive: false` to `keepAlive: true`
  - Provider was being disposed during async initialization (fetching contact list and reactions)
  - Home feed now correctly receives following list (14 users) and loads their videos (33 videos loaded)
  - Social state (following list, likes, reposts) now persists in memory as app-wide state

#### Root Cause
- `socialProvider` used `@Riverpod(keepAlive: false)` which caused auto-disposal when not actively watched
- `homeFeedProvider` reads it with `ref.read()` which doesn't keep the provider alive
- During async operations (`fetchCurrentUserFollowList()`, `fetchAllUserReactions()`), provider would dispose
- Result: Following list never populated, home feed incorrectly showed "Your Feed, Your Choice" empty state

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/providers/social_providers.dart`:
  - Line 20: Changed `@Riverpod(keepAlive: false)` to `@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)`
  - Updated comment to reflect disposal prevention and state caching
- Regenerated `lib/providers/social_providers.g.dart`:
  - Line 29: `isAutoDispose: false` (previously `true`)
- Provider still receives updates via state mutations and `ref.invalidate()`
- `keepAlive: true` only prevents disposal, doesn't affect reactivity

### Fixed - Video Controller Memory Management (2025-10-03)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed video controller disposal when entering camera** - Improved memory management for camera transitions
  - Camera screen now force-disposes all video controllers on entry (prevents ghost videos)
  - Additional disposal before navigating to profile after recording
  - Ensures no stale video controllers exist during tab switches
  - Prevents background video playback when camera is active

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/screens/pure/universal_camera_screen_pure.dart`:
  - Lines 44-54: Force dispose all controllers in initState
  - Lines 807-809: Additional disposal before profile navigation
  - Improved cleanup prevents IndexedStack widget lifecycle issues

### Changed - iOS Build Process (2025-10-03)

#### Improvements
- **Auto-increment build number for release builds** - Ensures App Store compliance
  - Release builds (`./build_ios.sh release`) now automatically increment build number
  - Debug builds only increment when `--increment` flag is explicitly passed
  - Updated usage documentation to reflect new behavior

#### Technical Details
- Modified `build_ios.sh`:
  - Lines 14-22: Conditional auto-increment logic for release vs debug
  - Lines 136-143: Updated usage documentation

### Fixed - Home Feed Video Loading (2025-01-30)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed home feed only loading 1 video** - Resolved race condition in video batch loading
  - Home feed provider now waits for complete video batch from relay instead of completing on first video
  - Implemented stability-based waiting: monitors video count and completes when stable for 300ms
  - Added 3-second maximum timeout as safety for slow connections
  - Uses proper event-driven pattern with Completer and ChangeNotifier listeners
- **Fixed home feed auto-refresh behavior**
  - Automatically refreshes when contact list changes (follow/unfollow)
  - Added 10-minute auto-refresh timer for background updates
  - Maintains proper keepAlive behavior to prevent unnecessary rebuilds
- **Fixed video swiping gesture conflicts**
  - Changed `enableLifecycleManagement` to `false` in home feed to match explore feed
  - Added missing `controller` parameter to VideoPageView for proper state management
- **Code quality improvements**
  - Removed unused imports and fields in home_feed_provider.dart
  - Fixed syntax error (trailing comma) in video_feed_screen.dart

#### Technical Details
- Modified `lib/providers/home_feed_provider.dart`:
  - Lines 126-163: Stability-based video loading with proper cleanup
  - Lines 80-93: Reactive listening for contact list changes
  - Lines 69-78: 10-minute auto-refresh timer
- Modified `lib/screens/video_feed_screen.dart`:
  - Added `controller: _pageController` to VideoPageView
  - Changed `enableLifecycleManagement: false`
