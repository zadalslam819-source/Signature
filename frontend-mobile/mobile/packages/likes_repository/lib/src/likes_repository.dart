/// Repository for managing user likes (Kind 7 reactions) on Nostr events.

/// This repository provides a unified interface for:
/// - Liking events (publishing Kind 7 reaction events)
/// - Unliking events (publishing Kind 5 deletion events)
/// - Querying like status and counts
/// - Syncing user's reactions from relays
/// - Persisting like records locally
///
/// The repository abstracts away the complexity of:
/// - Managing the mapping between target event IDs and reaction event IDs
/// - Coordinating between Nostr relays and local storage
/// - Handling optimistic updates and error recovery
///
/// This implementation:
/// - Uses `NostrClient` to publish reactions and deletions to relays
/// - Uses `LikesLocalStorage` to persist like records locally
/// - Maintains an in-memory cache for fast lookups
/// - Provides reactive streams for UI updates
/// - Supports real-time cross-device sync via persistent subscriptions
