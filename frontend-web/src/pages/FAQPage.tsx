                    diVine is an independent short-form video app inspired by Vine's creative 6-second format.
                    It allows you to create and share looping videos using the decentralized Nostr protocol,
                    making your content censorship-resistant and truly owned by you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike traditional social media platforms, diVine doesn't store your data on centralized
                    servers. Instead, it uses the Nostr protocol to distribute your content across a network
                    of independent relays.

                    Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a simple, open protocol that
                    enables censorship-resistant social media. Instead of storing data on one company's servers,
                    Nostr distributes content across many independent relays.

                  <p>
                    Your account is just a public/private key pair - no email, phone number, or personal
                    information required. This means true ownership and privacy.

                    Yes! Since Nostr is decentralized, you can use your account on any Nostr client
                    (diVine web, diVine iOS app, or any other Nostr app) by importing your private key
                    or connecting your browser extension. Your profile and content will appear the same

                    If you lose your private key (nsec), you lose access to your account permanently.
                    This is the trade-off for true decentralization - no company can recover your account,

                  <p>
                    Yes! We're currently beta testing a username registration system that allows you to
                    claim a human-readable address like username@divine.video (also known as a NIP-05 identifier).

                  <p>
                    A NIP-05 identifier is an email-like address that makes it easier for people to find and
                    verify you on Nostr. Instead of sharing a long public key (npub), you can share
                    username@divine.video.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Is it required?</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No! This is completely optional. Most users don't need a NIP-05 identifier to use Divine.
                    Your Nostr public key works perfectly fine for posting, following, and interacting on the platform.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The username registration system is currently in beta testing. If you're interested in

                    registration opens to all users.

                    <strong>How deletion works:</strong> When you delete a video, diVine removes it from our

                    requests. However, because Nostr is decentralized, some relays may retain copies - this is
                    the trade-off for a censorship-resistant platform.

                    your own relay list if you prefer. Using multiple relays ensures your content

                    diVine is <strong>not</strong> a blockchain, cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, or "Web3" project.
                    While diVine uses the Nostr protocol (a decentralized communication protocol), it has nothing
                    to do with cryptocurrency, NFTs, or blockchain technology. It's simply a video sharing platform
                    that gives you control over your content.
